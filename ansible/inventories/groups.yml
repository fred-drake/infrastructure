# The hosts.yml file contains all of my specific hostnames, their host-specific variables, and groups for each of these
# hosts.  The groups are defined as:
#
# critical: hosts that are considered critical towards keeping my network afloat (e.g. DNS, DHCP)
# services_docker1: docker host that runs a variety of services
# services_docker2: docker host that runs a variety of services
# critical_services_docker1: docker host that runs critical services

# These groups defined above are used below when building groups of groups

all:
  children:
    docker: # All docker servers
      children:
        services_docker1:
        services_docker2:
